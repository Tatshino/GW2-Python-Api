# GW2-Python-Api
This is a Guild Wars 2 python api that you can use

You don't have to worry about doing the requests or anything, this is a simple drag and drop

You will need to install requests to be able to use this
to install it use ```pip install requests```

you will need to get a api key from https://account.arena.net/applications

input your apikey you get where it says ```"your api key here"```

to get your guild id just type ```print(Character().charGuild)```
You'll have to comment out the guild class to avoid having issues when trying to retrieve your guild id

and remember to input your character name otherwise it won't work, 

you have to input your character name where it says ```"your character name here"```

after getting you rguild id you input it where it says ```"your guild id here"```


Hope you nejoy using this!

a documentation on how to use this in many ways will be created with the next version
